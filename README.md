# 🧬 Medical Dataset Analysis & Visualization

An end-to-end data analysis project focused on uncovering trends, patterns, and insights from a medical dataset. The goal is to support data-driven decisions in the healthcare domain by analyzing patient data, visualizing distributions, and highlighting correlations between features.

## 📊 Objectives

- Explore and clean medical data for analysis  
- Perform statistical summaries and correlation analysis  
- Visualize distributions of key medical indicators  
- Detect patterns related to age, gender, and health conditions

## 📁 Dataset

- Format: CSV  
- Fields include: `Age`, `Gender`, `BloodPressure`, `Cholesterol`, `Glucose`, `HeartRate`, etc.  
- Source: Public health dataset *(add exact source if applicable)*

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python 3  
- Pandas & NumPy – data manipulation  
- Seaborn & Matplotlib – data visualization  
- Jupyter Notebook – interactive exploration

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Blood pressure increases with age, especially in males  
- High glucose levels are more common in patients with high cholesterol  
- Positive correlation between BMI and blood pressure  
- Females showed slightly better heart rate stability in older age groups

## 📈 Visualizations

- Histograms for cholesterol, blood pressure, and age  
- Boxplots comparing health indicators by gender  
- Heatmap of feature correlations  
- Scatter plots to reveal variable relationships

## 🧪 Next Steps

- Use ML models for disease prediction (e.g. logistic regression)  
- Build a dashboard for hospital staff to track patient stats  
- Integrate time series if longitudinal data is available  
- Add anomaly detection to spot rare or critical cases
